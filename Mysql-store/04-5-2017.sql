The reason why we use the word extreme is because some blocks have just one color. But if you like minimalism and simplistic designs then this pack will likely be interesting to you. We tested it in a few different maps (medieval, modern and natural worlds) and in all of them it worked very well.\nThis is the first alpha release. As a result, there are some bugs, such as some mobs have the wrong sounds. There are also some blocks which still use the original Minecraft textures.','',1,0,'',1,'2017-05-04 15:15:00'),(1672,5,13,'WithersPVPPackV3','http://azminecraftskins.com/mcpe/mcpetextures/files/WithersPVPPackV3.zip','http://azminecraftskins.com/mcpe/mcpetextures/images/WithersPVPPackV3.jpg','http://azminecraftskins.com/mcpe/mcpetextures/thumbs/WithersPVPPackV3.jpg','Withy19','','16x16','Hello everyone I hope you like my texture pack\nVideo review : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx5sqaxiT6Azcdv-2cYWk0g','',1,0,'',1,'2017-05-04 15:15:00'),(1673,5,13,'Green Default Edit','http://azminecraftskins.com/mcpe/mcpetextures/files/GreenDefaultEdit.zip','http://azminecraftskins.com/mcpe/mcpetextures/images/GreenDefaultEdit.jpg','http://azminecraftskins.com/mcpe/mcpetextures/thumbs/GreenDefaultEdit.jpg','@AlphaSlayerZ_','','16x16','Default Edit !!!','',1,0,'',1,'2017-05-04 15:15:00'),(1674,5,13,'Seus Shaders 0.14.X','http://azminecraftskins.com/mcpe/mcpetextures/files/SeusShaders.zip','http://azminecraftskins.com/mcpe/mcpetextures/images/SeusShaders.jpg','http://azminecraftskins.com/mcpe/mcpetextures/thumbs/SeusShaders.jpg','MCPEFletcher','','32x32','SEUS SHADERS\nShaders Created By Criiz Fletcher \n---- \nNew!

This version is an early beta and includes features such as 20+ Pokémon, catch and release system and randomly generated structures. If you want to turn your Minecraft world into the universe of Pokémon then you need to give this one a try.\nGetting Started\nBefore getting started we highly recommend to download and use one of the Pokémon player skins to really make it look as if you were playing a Pokémon game.\nThere are currently more than 20 different Pokémon and they spawn naturally in different biomes throughout the world.\nThere features still quite limited at the moment. Right now you can only catch and spawn Pokémon.\n\nTo catch one begin by getting a poke ball from the creative inventory. Find a Pokémon which you want to catch then long press on the screen to through the poke ball and attempt the catch.\n\nThe catch rate is random and sometimes you are unlucky and have to redo it. In this case, I successfully managed to catch my Pokémon which was an Ivysaur. Dont forget to the pick up the poke ball.\nYou can catch up to 6 different Pokémon. The mod is using a slot system which can be accessed by the text chat.\n\nType any of the following commands in the text chat to manage your Pokémons:\n\nr = Release / Return Pokémon\ns0-5 (e.g. s1) = Select active slot\nd0-5 (e.g. d3) = Deletes the Pokémon in that slot\nIn the future you can expect a more slick user interface for this.\n\nAnyways, to summon a caught Pokémon type r in the chat.\nItem IDs\nThere are many more items than the ones listed here.

Each of them include a unique set of behaviors. For example, some of them you can tame and ride and others you have to be extra careful with since their aggressive behavior will make them want to kill and eat you. Also, make sure to try out the Jurassic Craft World map!\n\nDinosaurs\nYou can read more detailed information about each dinosaur by clicking the more info links for the dinosaur which you want to learn more about.\n\nAll of the following dinosaurs are included in the Jurassic Craft AddOn which can be downloaded at the bottom of this page.\n\nRaptors: Raptors (or formally known as Velociraptors) are formidable dinosaurs which play a prominent role in the Jurassic Park universe. Basic info: rideable, tameable, storage, replaces pigs.\n\nT-Rex : Tyrannosaurus Rex is believed to have been one of the largest carnivorous which lived during its time. Basic info: tameable, rideable, hostile, storage, replaces creepers.\n\nIndominus Rex:  Indominus Rex is a fictional dinosaur which played the role as the main antagonist in the latest Jurassic World movie.  Basic info: Extremely hostile, replaces iron golems, basically a boss.\n\nComposognathus : This the smallest dinosaur included in this AddOn. They are very dangerous if they get together as a group to chase their prey (e.g. the player). Basic info: distracted by meat, replaces husks.\n\nLudodactylus : The Ludodactylus is actually a flying reptile. Even though it looks as if it could eat you in just a few bites it is a non-hostile mob which will never do you any harm. Basic info: rideable, replaces bats.\n\nMosasaurus and Tylosaurus : The following mobs are aquatic reptiles which live in the water. Both of them enjoy the taste of fresh human so make sure to stay out of the water if you hold your life dear. Basic info: replaces the guardians and elder guardians\n\nBrachiosaurus : This is the least worrisome dinosaur which you can come across in Minecraft. They are very easy to spot because of their long neck but this also makes them an easy prey for hostile dinosaurs such as Indominus Rex. Basic info: replaces cow and mooshrooms.\n\nDilophosaurus and Oviraptor  : The Dilophosaurus in this AddOn is based on the one as seen in Jurassic Park. However, the one which lived on Earth in real life is in no way similar to this one so keep that in mind. This one has the ability to spit poison. Basic info: replaces wither skeletons and normal skeletons, attract with meat.\n\nSpinosaurus: This dinosaur was most likely larger than Tyrannosaurus Rex and you can bet that its hostile! Basic info: tameable, rideable, storage, replaces zombies.\n\nGallimimus : The Gallimimus must be one of the least frightful dinosaurs included in this AddOn. It is naturally afraid of players and will always try to run away. Basic info: tameable, rideable, replaces zombie pigmen.','',0,0,'',1,'2017-05-04 15:15:50'),(2584,1,13,'Banner And Flags Addon','http://azminecraftskins.com/mcpe/mcpemods/files/BannerAndFlags.addon','https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26776365/mcpemods/images/BannerAndFlags.jpg','https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26776365/mcpemods/thumbs/BannerAndFlags.jpg','StarkTMA','Minecraft PE 1.0.4',NULL,'This add-on adds a Minecraft PE 1.0.4 and higher, new decorations - banners and flags.\n\nThese items already exist in Minecraft PC, and now you can see them in advance in MCPE 1.0.4\n\nThe addon contains a lot of disadvantages, such as banners cannot be used fully because it is only a demo version.','',0,0,'',1,'2017-05-04 15:15:50'),(2585,1,13,'Tokyo Ghoul V2','http://azminecraftskins.com/mcpe/mcpemods/files/TokyoGhoulV2.addon','https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26776365/mcpemods/images/TokyoGhoulV2.jpg','https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26776365/mcpemods/thumbs/TokyoGhoulV2.jpg','sonicthe122','Minecraft PE 1.0.0',NULL,'New update this amazing addon for Minecraft PE 1.0 now includes:\n\n-masks\n\n-clothes\n\n-foods\n\n-objects\n\nredesigned -ghouls\n\nAnd more','',0,0,'',1,'2017-05-04 15:15:50'),(2586,1,13,'Milkable Squids Addon','http://azminecraftskins.com/mcpe/mcpemods/files/MilkableSquids.addon','https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26776365/mcpemods/images/MilkableSquids.jpg','https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26776365/mcpemods/thumbs/MilkableSquids.jpg','GartzkeMC','1.0.2',NULL,'Did you know that it was once possible to milk squids?\n\nI for sure didnt know that until now. \n\nIts very simple.

For the most part you are required to fight zombies and do a whole lot of running from one building to another as you try to find a solution for this zombie invasion. Nonetheless, its an enjoyable adventure where you get to experience the city of Springfield, meeting many famous characters from the show and fight zombies.\nRules\nRead all signs\nOnly enter buildings when signs/books advice you to\nNever break any blocks unless told to\nUse levers to open iron doors\nPlayer on a difficulty level which spawns zombies, preferably difficulty: —|\nHow to play the map?\nTo really get in tune with the adventure we highly recommend to use Homer Simpsons skin as its Homer the story is based around. As you spawn in the world you will find yourself stranded on the roof of Moes Tavern in Springfield. But things dont seem normal, there are zombies roaming the streets. Either you are just really drunk or something extremely bad must have happened.\n\nMr Burns appears to be the villain responsible for this chaos and its up to you to stop him and his army of zombies.\n\nThe download includes a text file which will act as the storyline (click here to access the book). At some places in-game there will be chests with a book and a sign. This will let you know when its time to start reading the book.\n\nMap Ending (important info) (dont read if you hate map spoilers!): After youve killed the Enderman boss the map appears to end. It seems as an abrupt ending but we havent figured out what to do next. If you do, let us know.

Your mission is to venture into an old temple and obtain an ancient (and possibly magic) artifact known as Tutankhamuns helmet. Some of the challenges include parkour, a puzzle and mob battles. Be careful and watch out for the deadly traps.\nStoryline\nYouve been sent to Egypt on a mission to find and retrieve a long forgotten artifact known as Tutankhamuns helmet. Its believed to give whoever wears the helmet god-like powers and as a result you can probably imagine its worth. (Tutankhamun was actually an Egyptian pharaoh (1332-1323 BC). The story about the helmet with magic powers is fiction though, just thought Id clarify that.)\nRules\nSet difficulty to max\nGamemode must be set to survival\nThere are several traps throughout the map. Be careful, otherwise theres a good chance youll die and have to start over.\nIf you enjoyed this map make sure to check out Tomb Crafter 1.
